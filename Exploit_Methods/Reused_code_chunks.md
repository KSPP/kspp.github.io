# Details

This is more generally knows as Return Oriented Programming (ROP) or
Jump Oriented Programming (JOP), but ultimately boils down to using the
kernel's own executable memory to build a chain of gadgets in order to
perform the attacker's exploit.

# Examples

  - [remote execution](https://github.com/djrbliss/rose-exploit)
    ([slides](http://vulnfactory.org/research/h2hc-remote.pdf))
  - [JIT spraying](https://github.com/01org/jit-spray-poc-for-ksp)

# Mitigations

  - compiler instrumentation for Control Flow Integrity (CFI)
  - Return Address Protection, Indirect Control Transfer Protection
    (e.g.
    [RAP](https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/PaXTeam-H2HC15-RAP-RIP-ROP.pdf))
  - Constant blinding (to defeat JIT sprays)
