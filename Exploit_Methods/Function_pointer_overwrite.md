# Details

When an attacker has a write primitive, they can overwrite function
pointers to redirect execution. Function pointers exist in a large
number of places in the kernel ranging from function pointer tables
(e.g. fops), to vector and descriptor tables.

# Examples

  - [security_operations
    overwrite](https://outflux.net/blog/archives/2010/10/19/cve-2010-2963-v4l-compat-exploit/)
  - [IDT, timer_list_fops, or security_operations
    overwrite](https://blogs.oracle.com/ksplice/entry/anatomy_of_an_exploit_cve)

# Mitigations

  - mark function pointer tables "const" when they can be statically
    assigned, making them read-only for the entire kernel runtime.
  - use __ro_after_init on function pointer tables that are only
    written during __init so they are read-only during the rest of the
    kernel runtime.
  - make all function pointer tables read-only at compile time (e.g.
    PAX_CONSTIFY_PLUGIN).
  - make sensitive targets that need only occasional updates only
    writable during rare updates (e.g. PAX_KERNEXEC).
