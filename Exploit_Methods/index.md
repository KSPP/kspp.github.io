Exploit Methods
===============

When [bugs](Bug_Classes) in the kernel provide unintended
read and write primitives to an attacker, there are many techniques used
to gain execution control over the kernel. Here we try to explain them,
link to examples, and link to defenses that are or could be used to
eliminate an exploitation method.
