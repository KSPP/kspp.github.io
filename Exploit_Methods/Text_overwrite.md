# Details

If an attacker has a write primitive and knows where the kernel is
located in memory, they could overwrite functions to do whatever they
wanted. Protecting against this is the most basic of kernel memory
protections: make sure the kernel is read-only.

# Examples

  - patch setuid to always succeed
  - [overwrite vDSO](http://itszn.com/blog/?p=21)

# Mitigations

  - Do not leave executable memory also writable
