Want to get involved in the [Kernel Self Protection Project](/)? Here's how:

# Join the conversations

  - Subscribe to the [**upstream** Linux kernel hardening mailing list](https://subspace.kernel.org/vger.kernel.org.html#:~:text=Hardening),
    `linux-hardening@vger.kernel.org`, where development,
    maintenance, and administrivia happen. (And visit the [list archive](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-hardening/).)
  - Come to the every-2-weeks status update meeting. See the
    [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=47005f8f50f21da6133d7239f3cb93d1624d2e1949963ea75dd86d5f2d5721e0@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles)
    for details.
  - Join the `#linux-hardening` IRC channel on
    [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/).
  - Optionally subscribe to the [**general** kernel hardening mailing list](https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/),
    `kernel-hardening@lists.openwall.com`, where new hardening
    topics for any kind of system (not just Linux) get discussed. (And visit the
    [list archive](https://lore.kernel.org/kernel-hardening/).)
      - Note: when sending to `kernel-hardening@lists.openwall.com`,
        please also CC `linux-hardening@vger.kernel.org` too.

# Introduce Yourself

Send an email to the lists to introduce yourself!

  - What topics are you interested in?
  - What do you want to learn about?
  - What experience do you have with security, the kernel, programming,
    or anything else you think is important.

# Pick something to work on

Pick something from the [issue tracker](https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues)
(or add a new one), coordinate on the mailing lists, and get
started. If your employer is brave enough to understand how
critical this work is, they'll pay you to work on it. If not, the
[OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/)'s [Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/)
group is in a great position to fund specific work proposals. We
need kernel developers, compiler developers, testers, backporters,
a documentation writers.

# Contribute patches

Please send new topics and patch series to
[linux-hardening@vger.kernel.org](https://subspace.kernel.org/vger.kernel.org.html#linux-hardening).

When contributing patches for the Linux kernel, be sure to follow the
Linux kernel [Coding Style Guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html)
and read about [Submitting Patches](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html).

Even if you're only sending your patches to the mailing lists for some
early review, it's best to get as much of the coding style and
submission semantics correct to avoid reviewers needing to recommend
changes in those areas.
